## BasicNodeNetworkProvider

`BasicNodeNetworkProvider` allows one to interact with the MultiversX Node (Observer) API. It's implementation would be extremely similar to `BasicProxyNetworkProvider`.

```
class BasicNodeNetworkProvider implements IBasicNetworkProvider;
    // The constructor should allow one to specify the base URL, custom request headers, etc.
```
