## TransfersController

Promotes all the functionality of `TransferTransactionsFactory` and `TransferTransactionsOutcomeParser`.

```
class TransfersController:
    // The constructor is not captured by the specs; it's up to the implementing library to define it.
    // Suggestions:
    constructor(network_provider: INetworkProvider);
```
